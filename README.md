# Overview
Fullscreen Optimizations Disabler or FOD for short is a simple tool that creates the needed registry keys for disabling Fullscreen Optimizations on any program/game.
It works on Windows 8 and later versions. It is currently very basic but im planning on making it a bit more user friendly and adding additional functionality.


# Usage
Just open the program and select which application you want to remove Fullscreen Optimizations from, after each application you will be asked if you want to add more.
When you are done adding everything just answer with "N" or "n" and the tool will close. Now all those applications will have Fullscreen Optimizations disabled.

# Why
Because disabling that setting usually increases FPS slightly and can sometimes decrease stuttering. (mostly found this out from personal experience and from friends)
Every time I Re-Install Windows I go through the trouble of disabling Fullscreen Optimizations on all the games I play which takes some time, so I made this tool to make
the process a bit faster. To be honest it doesn't make a big difference, if any at all. I mostly made the tool because I was bored and I felt like making it. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
